    "We are very pleased to announce the immediate availability of [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages). `fastpages` is a platform which allows you to create and host a blog for free, with no ads and many useful features, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create posts containing code, outputs of code (which can be interactive), formatted text, etc directly from [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/); for instance see this great [example post](https://drscotthawley.github.io/devblog3/2019/02/08/My-1st-NN-Part-3-Multi-Layer-and-Backprop.html) from Scott Hawley.  Notebook posts support features such as:\n",
    "    - Interactive visualizations made with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) remain interactive.\n",
    "    - Hide or show cell input and output.\n",
    "    - Collapsable code cells that are either open or closed by default.\n",
    "    - Define the Title, Summary and other metadata via a special markdown cells\n",
    "    - Ability to add links to [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and GitHub automatically.\n",
    "- Create posts, including formatting and images, directly from Microsoft Word documents.\n",
    "- Create and edit [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) posts entirely online using GitHub's built-in markdown editor.\n",
    "- Embed Twitter cards and YouTube videos.\n",
    "- Categorization of blog posts by user-supplied tags for discoverability.\n",
    "- ... and [much more](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)\n",
    "\n",
    "[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) relies on Github pages for hosting, and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate the creation of your blog. The setup takes around three minutes, and does not require any technical knowledge or expertise. Due to built-in automation of fastpages, you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  All you have to do is save your Jupyter notebook, Word document or markdown file into a specified directory and the rest happens automatically. Infact, this blog post is written in a Jupyter notebook, which you can see with the \"View on GitHub\" link above.\n",
    "\n",
    "[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) have previously released a similar project called [fast_template](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/), which is even easier to set up, but does not support automatic creation of posts from Microsoft Word or Jupyter notebooks, including many of the features outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because `fastpages` is more flexible and extensible, we recommend using it where possible.** `fast_template` may be a better option for getting folks blogging who have no technical expertise at all, and will only be creating posts using Github's integrated online editor."
